<h3>Here's what happened</h3>
<article>
		<p>
			The 2007-2008 post-election violence in Kenya was a severe crisis triggered by disputed presidential election results.
			Here’s a brief overview of what happened:
		</p>
	
		
			<h4 id="bold">Background</h4>
		<p>The general elections were held on December 27, 2007. The main contenders were the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki of the Party of National Unity (PNU) and Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).</p>
		
			<h4>Election Results and Dispute</h4>
			<p>Early results showed Odinga in the lead. On December 30, 2007, the Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) declared Mwai Kibaki the winner amidst allegations of vote rigging and fraud. Kibaki was swiftly sworn in as president, which heightened suspicions of electoral malpractice.</p>
		
			<h4>Outbreak of Violence</h4>
			<p>
				Supporters of Raila Odinga, particularly from his Luo ethnic group and other communities, protested the results, leading to widespread demonstrations. The violence quickly took on an ethnic dimension, pitting communities against each other. Kikuyu people, perceived to be Kibaki supporters, were targeted by groups from other ethnic communities. Kikuyu militias retaliated,
				leading to cycles of revenge attacks. The violence included killings, sexual violence, displacement of people, destruction of property, and severe human rights abuses.
			</p>
		
			<h4>Humanitarian Crisis</h4>
			<p>Over 1,100 people were killed. Approximately 600,000 people were displaced from their homes. Many displaced people were housed in temporary camps under poor conditions.</p>
		
			<h4>Efforts to Resolve the Crisis</h4>
				<p>
			The African Union, led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, mediated peace talks. In February 2008, a power-sharing deal was reached, resulting in the formation of a coalition
			government. Mwai Kibaki remained president, and Raila Odinga was appointed Prime Minister.The agreement included promises of substantial political and constitutional reforms to address
			the underlying issues of electoral injustice, land ownership, and ethnic tensions.
				</p>
		
		<h4>Aftermath</h4>
		<p>
			A commission was set up to address historical injustices and promote
			reconciliation.In 2010, the ICC indicted several high-profile Kenyan politicians for
			crimes against humanity related to the post-election violence, although the cases faced significant challenges and were
			eventually dropped.
		</p>
		<h4>Impact</h4>
		<p>
				The violence exposed deep-seated ethnic tensions and weaknesses in Kenya’s political
				system.The crisis severely affected Kenya's economy, with significant losses in tourism, investment, and
				overall economic growth.The 2007-2008 post-election violence in Kenya was a stark reminder of the potential for electoral disputes to escalate into widespread violence, underscoring the need for credible electoral processes and the importance of addressing
				underlying ethnic and social grievances.
